Have you ever accomplished something really cool after researching, experimenting and guessing for quite some time, only to tell someone about it and realize that you actually haven't the slightest idea how everything works in detail? Well, you're not alone.

Try to remember the last difficult problem you were working on. Do you feel like you're now an expert with the things involved, or that you could at least easily fix other related problems in the future?

Okay, now try to actually write down how you solved the problem. How did you figure out what the problem was, what caused it? Did you understand the entire problem and its cause and thought of a solid fix?
